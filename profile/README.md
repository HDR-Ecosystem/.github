# NSF HDR Ecosystem

NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea is a national-scale activity founded in 2016 to enable new modes of data-driven discovery that address fundamental questions at the frontiers of science and engineering.  By engaging NSF research community in the pursuit of fundamental research in data science and engineering, the ecosystem of HDR Institutes, Data Science Corps (DSC), and Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) strive to provide a cohesive, federated, national-scale approach to research data infrastructure, and the development of a 21st-century data-capable workforce.
